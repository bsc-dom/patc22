# PATC hands on

Welcome!

First part of the hands-on is contained in the `wordcount` folder. The solutions of the exercises can be found in the `wordcount-solutions` folder (the solution may not be unique, in case of doubt just ask). This part of the hands-on is done with Jupyter notebooks through a web browser.

If you don't have access to a `ssh` CLI command and use PuTTY instead, you can look at the `PuTTY-portfwd.png` image.

The dataClay hands-on is contained in the `matrices` folder. This part of the hands-on requires connecting to Mare Nostrum nodes.
